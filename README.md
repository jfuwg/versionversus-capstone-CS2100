This is my Capstone Project for CS2100 at the University of West Georgia.

It is a website called "VersionVersus" which aims to be a hub for video game version comparisons (original vs remake etc).

For those that don't want to watch a long form video elsewhere, this website can be used as a quick read, and even features articles to explain remakes and more.

The "Articles/Guides" section and "Comparisons" section host the articles and comparisons respectively while the About features a monthly survey.
